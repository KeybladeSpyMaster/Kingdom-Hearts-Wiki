                <h2>Please Note</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not click on the "Edit" links. The links do not currently work, and will only lead to blank pages. I hope to eventually bring editing functionality.</li>
                    <li>Do not use anything in "Options". The fly-out is a placeholder for future features (hopefully).</li>
                    <li>Music files and videos, including the Wiki's Podcast and Let's Play, do not currently play in-app, nor do they link to the YouTube videos in browser. I hope to bring this functionality soon.</li>
                    <li>The Wiki's Magazine does not currently display perfectly because of limitations on gradients. However, it's still mostly readable.</li>
                    <li>Anchor links do not currently work. They open the right page but do not skip to the anchored section.</li>
                </ul>
